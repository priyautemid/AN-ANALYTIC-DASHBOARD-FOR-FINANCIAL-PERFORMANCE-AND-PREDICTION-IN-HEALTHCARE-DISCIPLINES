# Financial Performance and Prediction Dashboard for Healthcare

This repository contains the code for an end-to-end solution built to analyze and predict the financial performance of healthcare disciplines. It includes the development of machine learning models for revenue prediction and the creation of interactive Power BI dashboards for visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) related to healthcare operations.

## Project Overview:
The objective of this project was to design a solution for predicting annual revenue and visualizing financial performance within healthcare organizations. By combining machine learning techniques and interactive data visualizations, the solution allows users to gain insights into financial trends, patient admissions, and departmental performance.

## Features:
- **Data Handling**:  
  - Preprocessing of time series data and healthcare operational data.
  - Data cleaning, feature engineering, and transformation for analysis.

- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Time Series Forecasting Models: ARIMA, LSTM for predicting future revenue trends.
  - Regression Models: XGBoost, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to predict annual revenue based on historical data.

- **Power BI Dashboards**:
  - Developed interactive dashboards using Power BI to visualize KPIs like revenue trends, patient admissions, and departmental performance.
  - Implemented DAX measures and calculated columns to build dynamic visuals such as bar charts, line graphs, and KPI cards.

## Note on Data:
Due to data confidentiality, the original dataset and corresponding visualizations are not included in this repository. The provided code and dashboard structure are meant to serve as templates for those interested in implementing similar solutions with their own data.
